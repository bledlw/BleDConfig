**Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: *10 August 2025*

As the developer of **BleDConfig**, I value your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the app.

**1. Information I Collect**

**1.1 User Authentication**

- I use Firebase Authentication with Apple Sign-In to enable you to create a secure, single account linked to your Apple ID.
- When you choose to sign in with Apple, I do **not** collect or store your personal information such as your name, email, or any other data from Apple. Only the authentication token provided by Apple is used internally for identity verification.
- This setup ensures a seamless login experience while respecting your privacy.

**1.2 Device and Usage Data**

- My app uses Firebase SDK components (FirebaseCore and FirebaseAuth) that may automatically collect technical information to help monitor and improve the app.
- This may include:
  - A **random, anonymous, unique identifier** associated with your device or app installation.
  - Device details such as model, operating system version, and app version.
  - IP address temporarily, mainly for security, fraud prevention, and analytics.
  - Crash reports and performance data to enhance stability and user experience.
- I do not collect or transmit any data from your Bluetooth peripherals or usage information beyond what is necessary for app functionality and improvement.

**1.3 Bluetooth Interaction**

- The app communicates with nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripherals using the CoreBluetooth framework.
- These communications are limited to device discovery, connection, and control commands.
- I do **not** collect, store, or transmit any data from these connected Bluetooth devices to any remote servers.

**2. How I Use Your Information**

- To authenticate you securely using Firebase.
- To provide, support, and improve the app's features, including Bluetooth device control.
- To monitor app performance, fix bugs, and improve stability through crash data and analytics.
- To ensure security and prevent abuse, including detecting malicious activities.

**3. Data Sharing and Storage**

- I **do not** sell, rent, or trade your personal or device data to third parties.
- Data processed via Firebase may be stored on servers around the world, governed by Google's [Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
- Any data related to your Bluetooth peripherals stays on your device.

**4. Data Retention and Deletion**

- Your unique device/application identifier and related app data are retained only as long as the app is installed on your device.
- If you delete your account within the app, all locally stored data (such as **BleDDevices**) is erased immediately.
- When you uninstall the app, all locally stored data, including Bluetooth device information, is also removed.
- I do **not** retain or store this data on any remote servers.

**5. Your Rights & Control**

- Since I do **not** process or store personally identifiable data from your Apple ID or device beyond authentication, there are limited rights regarding data access or deletion.
- You have the right to delete your account in the app at any time, which will remove all local data.
- You can also uninstall the app to delete all locally stored Bluetooth device data.

**6. Data Security**

- I implement reasonable security measures to protect your data on the device.
- Firebase analytics and crash data help identify issues but do not contain personally identifiable information unless you share it explicitly.

**7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

- The app is intended for all users. I do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If I discover that I have inadvertently collected such data, I will delete it promptly.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

- I may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in my data practices or legal requirements.
- Any updates will be made publicly available within the app or remotely, with the "Last Updated" date revised accordingly.
