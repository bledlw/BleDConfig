        <h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>How many devices can I create without a subscription?</h3>
	<p>Users are permitted to create one <b>BleDDevice</b> controller. Each device can contain up to one free control. All control types are available; the limitation applies solely to the quantity. To add additional controls or devices, users may subscribe to the auto-renewable plan, which grants unlimited access to devices, controls, and runs.</p>
	<h3>Are the configured devices stored remotely?</h3>
	<p>No. All devices are stored locally on the device. Reinstalling the application will result in the removal of all device configurations. To preserve your devices, it is recommended to share and securely save the configuration data externally.</p>
	<h3>Is there a limit to the number of controls I can create?</h3>
	<p>For users with an active subscription, the limit corresponds to the available grid space. The control grid measures 6 x 12 units; the number of controls depends on the selected control type. Users without an active subscription are limited to creating only one <b>BleDControl</b>.</p>
	<h3>How can I run a configured BleDDevice?</h3>
	<p>A configured device can be run by simply tapping on its representation within the app.</p>
	<h3>How do I configure a BleDDevice?</h3>
	<p>Begin by editing the existing device to add discovery filtering options such as <code>AdvertisementData / ManufacturerData</code>, <code>AdvertisementData / ServiceUUIDs</code>, or <code>Name</code>. Filtering supports regular expression patterns, with a maximum length of 512 characters. After configuring the filters, you can manage its associated <b>BleDControl</b>.</p>
	<h3>How do I verify if my BleDControls are configured correctly?</h3>
	<p>A dedicated icon/badge appears in the top-right corner of each control. Controls that are improperly configured display this icon. Additionally, when running the device, only properly configured controls will be active.</p>
	<h3>Why are some controls absent when I run BleDDevice?</h3>
	<p>Only controls that are correctly configured will be present and operational during device execution.</p>
	<h3>I am unsure if I configured a BleDControl properly because I do not observe the expected behavior. What should I do?</h3>
	<p>There are two additional debugging methods aside from the icon badge:</p>
	<ul>
    		<li>Use the Console app to capture logs related to connectivity and data exchange. Filter logs with <code>bled::cm::</code>. Detailed instructions are provided within the <b>BleDControl</b> configuration view.</li>
    		<li>Simulate <b>BleDControl</b> behavior by sending custom HexStrings via the input field above the control preview. You can also test data transmitted from <b>BleDControl</b> to the connected peripheral.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How can I share a BleDDevice configuration?</h3>
	<p>Long-press the device to trigger the context menu, then select Distribute / Share.</p>
	<h3>How can I import a BleDDevice configuration?</h3>
	<p>Tap on the <code>.beldconfig</code> file and open it within the <b>BleDConfig</b> application.</p>
	<h3>Is there a possibility to publish devices live so that anyone can run them?</h3>
	<p>Not yet. I am working on the ability to publish <b>BleDDevice</b> configurations so anyone can trigger them using either QR codes or AppClips. Currently, the only way to share a <b>BleDDevice</b> configuration is with users who have the <b>BleDConfig</b> app installed.</p>
	<h3>Are there plans to extend the set of available controls?</h3>
	<p>Yes. In the next app version, new control types are expected to be introduced.</p>
